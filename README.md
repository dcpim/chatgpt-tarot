## ChatGPT-Tarot

This is a simple ChatGPT powered static website. It contains 2 parts:

* The script in /script can be used to select random cards, then get a reading from ChatGPT and populate the readings.json file.
* The static HTML files in /html can be placed on any public web site, even an S3 bucket, and it will pick a random entry from the JSON file and present it to the viewer.
